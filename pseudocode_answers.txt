Programming Assignment

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number
	PRINT "First number
ELSE
	PRINT "second number
END IF


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT total to 0
WHILE the total is not 100
	ADD 1 to total
	PRINT "Total"
END WHILE


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
SET Phonebook
INPUT last Name
IF last name equals last name field of phone book
	PRINT "Last Name, First Name, Phone Number
ELSE
	PRINT "Can not find contact"
END IF


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function biggerNumber (a,b) {
  if (a > b) {
    Console.log(a)
  }
  console.log(b)
}
